                    It took us 7 long years to build MyClassBoard , the most feasible software for schools affiliated to multiple boards of education, such as CBSE, ICSE, SSC, and also IGCSC. We made a deep dive into the School Management, its complexities, maintenance of multiple records, people management system, Accounting system, etc. Every implementation has been a learning curve for us. Since every School Management has a unique system to customize, every feature that has been added in customization has enhanced the scalability of MyClassBoard.<br />
